![Sortify Logo](Documentation%20assets/Sortify%20logo.png)

## What is Sortify?

**Sortify** is a user-friendly file sorting utility created to simplify the process of organizing your files. It automatically categorizes and moves files into appropriate folders based on their file extensions. Sortify is built using Python 3.8 and relies on well-known and trusted libraries such as tkinter, customtkinter, Pillow, pathlib, os, and shutil, ensuring a safe and reliable user experience.


## Key Features

### 1. Effortless File Organization

Sortify empowers you to declutter your folders and keep your files neatly organized. With a few clicks, you can arrange your files into designated folders, making it easier to locate and manage your data.

### 2. Customizable Categories

Tailor Sortify to your specific needs by customizing file categories and folder destinations. You have the flexibility to create and modify categories, ensuring that your files are sorted exactly the way you want them.

### 3. Adobe Files Handling

Sortify simplifies the management of Adobe-related file extensions, including Photoshop Files, Illustrator Files, Premier Pro Files, and After Effects Files. These extensions are intelligently grouped under the "Adobe Files" category, streamlining your file organization.

### 4. Dark and Light Modes

Enjoy a personalized user experience by toggling between dark and light themes. Sortify adapts to your preferred working environment, enhancing visual comfort during file sorting.

## Getting Started

### Selecting a Directory

To begin sorting your files, follow these steps:

1. Click the **"Browse"** button to choose the directory containing the files you want to sort.

2. The selected directory path will appear in the entry box.

### Sorting Files

Once you've selected a directory:

1. Click the **"Sort"** button to initiate the file sorting process.

2. Sortify will automatically move files to their respective folders based on their extensions and the chosen categories.

### Customizing Categories

In case you want to sort specific files instead of the whole folder:

1. In the sidebar, you'll find checkboxes corresponding to different categories, excluding "Adobe Files"; because it has subfolders that sort into: Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier Pro, and After Effects folders.

2. Customize your file organization by selecting checkboxes associated with your preferred categories.

3. For Adobe files, use the dedicated **"Adobe Files"** checkbox to enable grouping.

### Undo Sorting

Need to reverse the sorting process? Sortify provides an **"Undo Sorting"** button that moves files back to their original locations.


### Available Extensions

Explore the **"Available Extensions"** button to view a comprehensive list of file extensions and their corresponding categories.

### Theme Selection

Sortify offers both light and dark themes to match your workspace preferences. Toggle the **"Light Mode"** switch to switch between themes effortlessly.

## Versions and Updates:
### Version 1.1 (2/10/2023): 

&ensp; 1- Fixed Undo Sorting to remove folders only created by Sortify and not the already existing ones (user folders)


&ensp; 2- Fixed clicking Undo Sorting twice to unsort the sub folders of Adobe Files


&ensp; 3- Renamed some folders so it doesn't affect them when unsorting or sorting


&ensp; 4- Sortify has been recompiled with cx_freeze instead of Pyinstaller which doesn't cause any antivirus triggers or false positives



 **â€¢ Note: the Undo Sorting button now works based on the file names provided in the app, so if you name some of your folders the same as one of them they'll be affected.**
